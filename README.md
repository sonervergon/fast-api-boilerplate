# Typethon - A TS & Py Monorepo boilerplate

ðŸš§ WIP

![Icon](typethon.png)

Typethon is a Typescript pnpm monorepo with Turborepo containing a Python backend service and a Vite web application. Meant to provide a seamles developer experience for Typescript and Python devs. It's a minimal repository containing a Python backend, a Vite React app, and an autogenerated api-client that outputs a react-query client.

## Monorepo Structure

```
typethon/
â”œâ”€â”€ apps/                 # Application packages
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core/             # Core Python API service
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ bin/          # Core-specific scripts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ web/              # Vite web application
â”œâ”€â”€ packages/             # Shared packages (libraries, components, etc.)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ api-client/       # Autogenerated TypeScript API client with React Query hooks
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json          # Root package configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ pnpm-workspace.yaml   # Workspace configuration
â””â”€â”€ turbo.json            # Turborepo configuration
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm 10+
- Python 3.9+ (for Python services)

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Set up Python environment:

```bash
pnpm setup-env
```

This will run the setup scripts for all Python services in parallel using Turborepo.

### Development

Start all services in development mode:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will start all the services in parallel using Turborepo.

## Available Services

### Core API Service

The Core API service is a Python backend service using FastAPI with a layered architecture.

### Web Application

A modern Vite-powered web application that connects to the Core API.

### API Client

An autogenerated TypeScript client that provides type-safe access to the Core API endpoints with built-in React Query hooks. This package automatically synchronizes with the Python backend's API definitions.

## Monorepo Scripts

- `pnpm dev` - Run all services in development mode using Turborepo
- `pnpm setup-env` - Initialize Python environments for all services in parallel
- `pnpm build` - Build all packages using Turborepo
- `pnpm lint` - Lint all packages using Turborepo

## Adding New Services

1. Create a new directory in the appropriate folder:

   - For applications: `apps/<service-name>`
   - For shared packages: `packages/<package-name>`

2. Add the service to the workspace by updating its package.json

3. Add the service to the Turborepo pipeline in `turbo.json` if needed

4. The service will be automatically included in the root dev command
